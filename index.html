            <h2>Bio<span>graphy</span></h2>
            <p>Lionel Messi, born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers in history. He displayed prodigious talent from a young age, joining Newell's Old Boys at just six years old. However, at 11, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency that required costly treatment. This led his family to make the difficult decision to move to Spain when he was 13, where he joined FC Barcelona’s famed youth academy, La Masia.
               Messi made his first-team debut for Barcelona in 2004, and his ascent to stardom was rapid. Over 17 years with the club, he shattered records, becoming Barcelona's all-time leading scorer and winning an astounding number of titles, including 10 La Liga championships and 4 UEFA Champions League titles. His individual accolades include seven Ballon d'Or awards, highlighting his status as the best player in the world multiple times.
               Messi is celebrated for his exceptional dribbling, vision, and playmaking abilities. His chemistry with teammates, especially during the iconic era alongside players like Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, transformed Barcelona into one of the most successful teams in football history. In 2021, due to financial constraints that prevented Barcelona from renewing his contract, Messi signed with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), where he continued to showcase his extraordinary skills.
               On the international stage, Messi faced scrutiny early in his career for not winning major tournaments with Argentina. However, he led the national team to victory in the 2021 Copa América, securing his first major international trophy. The pinnacle of his international career came in 2022 when he captained Argentina to win the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, solidifying his legacy as one of the sport's all-time greats.
               Off the pitch, Messi is known for his philanthropic efforts. He established the Leo Messi Foundation, which focuses on education and health care for vulnerable children. His humble personality and dedication to the game have made him a beloved figure worldwide.                
               Messi’s impact extends beyond football; he has become a global icon, inspiring countless fans and aspiring athletes. His journey from a small boy with big dreams to a legend of the game is a testament to his talent, hard work, and perseverance.</p>
